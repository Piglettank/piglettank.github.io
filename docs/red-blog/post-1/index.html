<h2 id="1-sweden-has-worse-wealth-equality-than-us">1. Sweden has worse wealth equality than U.S.</h2>
<p>There are different ways to measure inequality in a society. By the difference in income, and by the difference in capital/net worth. In the world of capitalism, more money makes more money.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Gini income inequality</strong>: Working class people having different amount of monthly income. This can vary between 25 000 SEK - 100 000 SEK or even more in Sweden. A large inequality that can make groups of people feel less empowered or important than others. This is however <strong>not</strong> where the real inequality lies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gini wealth inequality</strong>: The difference in WEALTH. How much money has your family accumulated? How much land do you own? How much companies, shares and other types of wealth do you have? THIS is where the real inequality lays. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_by_wealth_inequality#List">Here</a> you can see that in terms of wealth inequality (0 is perfectly equal, 1 is maximal inequality). Sweden is worse of the U.S., known for its massive oligarch companies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2-productivity-increase-conditions-remain">2. Productivity increase, conditions remain</h2>
<p>Most workplaces put lots of importance on making things easier, faster and better. Making slow processes fast. If you are a worker that strongly contributed, the best reward you can get is a salary increase. 10% boost of your wages. And maybe well liked by the boss.</p>
<p>A company under capitalism focus on profits. No matter if things get more productive, you will not be the one to reap the rewards. If you can now perform a task in 4 hours that previously took you 8 hours. Your salary will not double and your working hours will not be halved.</p>
<p>Take a step back. Consider how much more efficient all sectors have gotten over the last 40 years. Massive development in technology and workflows. Yet the working conditions remain. Salary remain. Things might slowly get better and more affordable, but not in the same speed as companies get more profitable. This is proved to me by the <em>gini wealth coefficient</em> rising. If more and more money gets concentrated in the top 1%, that means more and more productivity increases yet is does not benefit the masses.</p>
<h2 id="3-conditions-only-improve-when-workers-fight">3. Conditions only improve when workers fight</h2>
<p>A capitalist does not make your working conditions better just because he has more profit. Large wage increases or significant improvement to working conditions have only been made by workers going to strikes or violently fighting for their rights.</p>
<h2 id="4-no-parlament-party-is-the-workers-party">4. No parlament party is the worker’s party</h2>
<p>Democracy is great! But where is my party that removes the assets of the top 1% and redistributes them to the workers? Where is my party that calls for 4 hour work days? I don’t see it.</p>
<h2 id="5-criminality">5. Criminality</h2>
<p>Main reason for people doing crime? Poverty, low socio-economic status.
Solution? Arrest them.
No. Solution is reduce the difference in socio-economic status. Even a dumbass can see that.</p> </body></html>
