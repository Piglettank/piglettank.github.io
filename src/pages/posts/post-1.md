# My first blog

Published: Today

Welcome to my _new blog_. I hope to learn a lot.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created and set up the Astro project

2. **Making pages**: I then learned how to set up page and the routes it creates

3. **Making blog posts**: This is the start of blog posting! I now have a folder for all my blogs posts

## What's next

I hope to complete the tutorial. I think by the end I will have learned much more than when I started
